# Face-recogniton---attendance-system
This project is a real-time face recognition system designed to mark attendance. It utilizes Dlib's face recognition capabilities to extract and match face features and stores attendance data in an SQLite database. The system includes a Flask-based web application for viewing attendance records. The project also integrates a Raspberry Pi with a camera module to capture faces in real-time, making it a portable and efficient solution for tracking attendance. The Raspberry Pi processes live video feeds to detect and recognize faces, enabling seamless operation in various environments.
